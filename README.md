# NSBLPA Prototype

## How to Run
Just download the project folder and open the file `index.html` in your web browser.  
No server setup is needed – everything works offline.

## Assumptions & Design Choices
- The design is mobile-first, so it looks good on phones first and then scales up for tablets and desktops.  
- I used HTML5 and CSS3 with flexbox and grid for layout.  
- The code is kept simple, semantic, and accessible.  

## What’s Inside
- `index.html` (Home)  
- `ownership.html`  
- `teams.html`  
- `apps.html`  
- `contact.html`  
- `assets/` folder with CSS, JS, and images  

## Assets
- Demo logos are included in the `assets/` folder.

This is a basic prototype to show layout, responsiveness, and structure.
